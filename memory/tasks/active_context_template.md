# Active Development Context - Effect Regex CLI

## Current Work Focus:
*   Setting up comprehensive development environment with rulebook-ai
*   Customizing memory bank documentation for Effect/TypeScript project
*   Establishing project structure and coding standards

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
*   **CLI Command Structure:** Deciding between subcommands (match, replace, validate) vs single command with flags
*   **Error Handling Strategy:** How much Effect error handling vs user-friendly messages
*   **File Processing:** Streaming vs in-memory for large files (currently favoring streaming)
*   **Output Formatting:** JSON vs plain text vs colored output options

## Recent Changes:
*   Integrated rulebook-ai for comprehensive AI assistant rule management
*   Set up git hooks with husky for automatic code formatting
*   Added EditorConfig for consistent editor settings
*   Enhanced CI/CD with linting checks
*   Customized memory bank templates with project-specific content
*   Created detailed PRD, technical specs, and architecture documentation

## Next Steps:
*   Implement core CLI commands (match, replace, validate)
*   Add comprehensive test coverage
*   Refine error messages and user experience
*   Add file input/output support
*   Performance optimization for large text processing
