# Product Requirement Document - Effect Regex CLI

## 1. Introduction
*   **Project Name:** effect-regex
*   **Document Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** October 2025
*   **Author(s):** Development Team
*   **Purpose:** This document outlines the requirements for a command-line regex processing tool built with Effect, providing robust pattern matching capabilities with functional programming principles.

## 2. Goals
*   **Business Goals:** Create a reliable, maintainable regex tool that demonstrates Effect's capabilities and serves as a reference implementation.
*   **User Goals:** Enable developers to perform complex regex operations with confidence, type safety, and predictable error handling.

## 3. Background and Rationale
*   **Problem:** Existing regex tools often lack proper error handling, type safety, and composability. Effect provides an excellent framework for building robust functional programs.
*   **Market Analysis:** Target audience includes functional programmers, TypeScript developers, and teams adopting Effect framework.
*   **Competitive Analysis:** Differentiates through Effect's functional approach, superior error handling, and type safety compared to imperative regex libraries.

## 4. Scope
*   **In Scope:**
    - Core regex pattern compilation and validation
    - Text matching and replacement operations
    - Effect-based error handling and recovery
    - Command-line interface with multiple subcommands
    - TypeScript implementation with full type safety

*   **Out of Scope:**
    - GUI interface
    - Real-time regex testing interface
    - Advanced regex features not supported by JavaScript RegExp

## 5. Target Audience
*   **Target Users:** TypeScript developers, functional programmers, developers learning Effect, and teams adopting functional programming practices.

## 6. Requirements

### 6.1. Functional Requirements
*   The CLI must support regex pattern compilation with validation
*   The CLI must support text matching operations (match, test, search)
*   The CLI must support text replacement operations
*   The CLI must support global and case-insensitive flags
*   The CLI must provide clear error messages for invalid regex patterns
*   The CLI must support reading input from files and stdin

### 6.2. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance:** Must handle large text inputs efficiently
*   **Reliability:** Must provide predictable error handling using Effect
*   **Maintainability:** Must follow functional programming principles
*   **Usability:** Must provide clear CLI help and error messages

## 7. Release Criteria
*   **Definition of Done:** All core regex operations implemented, tests passing, documentation complete
*   **Acceptance Testing:** Manual testing of all CLI commands, unit test coverage > 80%

## 8. Success Metrics
*   Successful demonstration of Effect's capabilities in a real-world application
*   Positive feedback from Effect community
*   Clean, maintainable codebase following functional principles

## 9. Risks and Challenges
*   **Learning Curve:** Effect framework has a learning curve
*   **JavaScript RegExp Limitations:** Limited to JavaScript's regex capabilities
*   **CLI Complexity:** Building a good CLI interface requires careful design

## 10. Open Issues
*   Determine exact CLI command structure
*   Decide on output formatting options

## 11. Future Considerations
*   WebAssembly compilation for better performance
*   Support for additional regex engines
*   Integration with other Effect ecosystem tools

## 12. Glossary
*   **Effect:** A functional programming framework for TypeScript
*   **Regex:** Regular expressions for pattern matching
*   **CLI:** Command-line interface
