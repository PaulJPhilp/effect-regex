# Technical Specifications - Effect Regex CLI

## 1. Introduction
*   **Project Name:** effect-regex
*   **Document Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** October 2025
*   **Author(s):** Development Team
*   **Purpose:** Technical specification for a regex processing CLI built with Effect framework.

## 2. Goals
*   **Technical Goals:** Demonstrate functional programming with Effect, ensure type safety, provide robust error handling
*   **Business Goals:** Create a reference implementation showcasing Effect's capabilities

## 3. Development Environment
*   **Operating Systems:** macOS, Linux, Windows
*   **Programming Languages:** TypeScript 5.x
*   **Frameworks:** Effect 3.x, @effect/cli
*   **Libraries:** @effect/platform-node, @effect/vitest
*   **Development Tools:** Biome (linting/formatting), Vitest (testing), tsup (bundling)

## 4. Technologies Used
*   **Technology Stack:** Node.js runtime, TypeScript, Effect framework
*   **Technology Selection Rationale:**
    - **Effect:** Chosen for functional programming, type safety, and composable error handling
    - **TypeScript:** Provides compile-time type checking and better developer experience
    - **Biome:** Fast, comprehensive linting and formatting tool
    - **Vitest:** Modern testing framework with Effect integration

## 5. Framework Guidelines
*   **Effect Patterns:** Follow EFFECT.md for functional programming patterns
*   **TypeScript Patterns:** Follow TYPESCRIPT.md for advanced type patterns
*   **Code Style:** Biome with ultracite preset, strict TypeScript configuration

## 6. Key Technical Decisions
*   **Effect Framework:** Provides functional programming primitives, dependency injection, and error handling
*   **CLI-first Design:** Command-line interface allows for easy automation and scripting
*   **TypeScript Strict Mode:** Ensures maximum type safety and catches potential runtime errors
*   **Functional Architecture:** Pure functions, immutable data, composable effects

## 6. Design Patterns
*   **Effect Pattern:** Using Effect for handling side effects, errors, and dependencies
*   **Tag Pattern:** Using Effect Tags for dependency injection
*   **Layer Pattern:** Composing application layers for modularity
*   **Functional Core, Imperative Shell:** Pure business logic with Effect handling side effects

## 7. Technical Constraints
*   **JavaScript RegExp Engine:** Limited to features supported by JavaScript's RegExp
*   **Node.js Runtime:** Requires Node.js for execution
*   **Single-threaded:** Operations are synchronous unless explicitly made concurrent

## 8. API Specifications
*   **CLI Commands:**
    - `effect-regex match <pattern> <text>` - Test regex pattern against text
    - `effect-regex replace <pattern> <replacement> <text>` - Replace matches
    - `effect-regex validate <pattern>` - Validate regex pattern syntax

## 9. Data Storage
*   **No persistent storage:** CLI tool processes data in memory
*   **Input/Output:** Reads from stdin/files, writes to stdout

## 10. Security Considerations
*   **Input validation:** Regex patterns are validated before compilation
*   **No arbitrary code execution:** Pure regex operations only
*   **Memory limits:** Large inputs handled efficiently to prevent memory exhaustion

## 11. Performance Considerations
*   **Regex compilation caching:** Patterns compiled once and reused
*   **Streaming input:** Large files processed efficiently
*   **Effect optimization:** Minimal overhead from Effect framework

## 12. Scalability Considerations
*   **Memory efficient:** Processes data in chunks for large inputs
*   **CPU efficient:** Regex operations are fast, Effect overhead minimal
*   **Concurrent processing:** Can be extended to handle multiple files concurrently

## 13. Open Issues
*   Determine optimal CLI argument parsing
*   Implement comprehensive error reporting

## 14. Future Considerations
*   Add support for additional regex engines (PCRE, etc.)
*   Implement streaming for very large files
*   Add regex performance benchmarking

## 15. Glossary
*   **Effect:** Functional programming framework for TypeScript
*   **Tag:** Effect's dependency injection mechanism
*   **Layer:** Effect's way of composing services
*   **Regex:** Regular expressions for pattern matching
